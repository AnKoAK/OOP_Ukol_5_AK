2nd commit
First change in GIT_Illustrative_File_AK.
Change was done after 1st commit.

2nd commit
Still 2nd commit but changed after saving the previous note upper. 

5th commit
3rd commit was just correction of 2nd commit beceause modified files weren't
added in 2nd commits so it had to be commited.
4th commit was done just in branch 'branchAK' 
so the change didn't occure in the branch 'master'.
At the same time as this commit waa written, 
there was created another change of this file in 'branchAK'. 
So there are two parallel changes of the same file.
